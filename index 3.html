     <li>playing video games</li>
     <li>watching wrestling</li>

   </ul></font>
<br>
<p><font color="white"> but between all of this hobby that i have, the most things that i like to do is listening to music rock and watching wrestling</p></font>
<br>
<p><font color="white"><b> for the watching wrestling, actually when i first watched wrestling at that time i'm still 6 years old. it is not such a good
    shows for my ages and my mother also mad at me most of the time when i watched wrestling but i deosn't know why wreslting is
    so much fun to me and its quite amazing!!why not? with all the moves that those wrestler give its super amazing, them do a lot of
    so much training just to do it that kind of super amazing moves. A lot of people said that wreslting is fake and them actually doesn't take
    the real deal or real damage, but for your information them actually takes the real damage and sometimes them got bleeding, bruise and other
    things. but what make them still could take all the damaged is because of the training that they do it. because of that their body become get
    used to it. wrestling is not just about of fighting, beat somebody just to get the title, but wrestling actually taught me a lot of things,
    passion, desire to keep fighting even do you were beating the world out of you, and it also about the value that conclude besides those matches
    in wrestling. why you still keep fighting until the end even do you was beating so badly, because you will never give up with what you want, you 
    want to win and you want to prove to lot of your family,friends and fans that you can do it, thats why you still could standing on both of your 
    feet and still raise both of your knuckles and ready to throw those punches. that values make me love wrestling so much and if you doesn't see it
    don't call yourself as a wrestling fans and for your information i also learned english from wreslting, ohh i loves all of those wrestling when
    them holding a microphone and speake for themself.</p></font></b>
<br>
<p><font color="white">for my next hobby that i liked the most is listening to the rock music, why? maybe for those kids nowadays them won't here it nowadays but not
    for me, for me rock music have a lot of the things, the lyrics, the message that them want to deliver throught the song, the energetic performances,
    and the most of the important things is this rockers used a music as a platform for them to share with all the people about the things that people
    doesnt care about it, maybe things that people afraid to say it, but them doesn't care about it. them used a song for them to fight against those people
    and stand for the humanity and many other things. that's why rock music always be such a great genre for the whole time</P></font>
